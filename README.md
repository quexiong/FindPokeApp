# Pokemon Hunt App
This is a Pokémon based game where players have to correctly find randomly selected Pokémon. 

## How It Works
The game is very simple to play. First, from the landing page, read the instructions, then start the game. When the game starts, the game will randomly generate a selection of Pokémon from Generation I through Generation IV. You will then be asked to find 1 of those Pokémon that exists in the game board. However, be aware that the challenge of the game is that you are being timed while you search for the Pokémon. The faster you can correctly find the Pokémon, the higher the final score will be. Once you find 10 total Pokémon, the final score will be caculated and your final results will be reported to you.
